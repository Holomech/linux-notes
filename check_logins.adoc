= How to check who was logged on last in your Linux sytem
Holomech

== Show past successful logins
Any regular user can check, who was logged on in the past.
Here is how to do it.

. Open a terminal window.
. Use the following command to show past successful logins.

[source,Shell]
----
last | less # <1>
----
<1> It is better to pipe the output of the _last_ command through the _less_ utility, as the output can be quite long.

In the output you should see several columns. The first is the username, followed by that user's terminal identifier.
You can also see the date and time of the successful login.
